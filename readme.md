# Overview
EMTs need to be able to respond quickly to emergencies and often times, patients are unable to relay important information about their health and treatment history. When every moment is precious, it is crucial that EMTs have all necessary health information so they can begin effective treatment immediately. Medical cards can hold such information but are often not carried on everyoneâ€™s person and also pose a risk to privacy. A QR-code linked medical profile is easy to put on stickers or link to IDs and only gives certain authorized medical personnel the ability to access PHI.
